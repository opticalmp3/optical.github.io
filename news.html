        <h1 class="headLine">5/20/2019 - First Shadow Ban!</h1>
        <p class="articles">The other day I noticed something strange about my account. Then after my Insta profile loaded it told
            me one of my posts was taken down. This particular post was the "Boys Locker Room" meme I made that showed a couple of
            guys duking it out in Panera or something. Later I realized that was only the beggining. As if one post getting taken
            down wasnt enough for a shadow-ban, then try getting report blasted. Everything I put out was getting reported.
            Even some comments I made were reported, which was very odd and a very clear personal attack. Thus, I was forced to
            delete all my posts so the douchebag thats report blasting me has nothing to report. If the person who is report
            -blasting me is reading this, please reach out to me. This is a very clear and obvious personal attack, and ive made
            many friends in this game, but I have yet to meet an enemy. But other than all that im doing just peachy!
