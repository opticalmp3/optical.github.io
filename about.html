        <p class="paragraphs">I am a Instagram meme creator thats been making memes since February,2016 I am a contnet
            creator with a passion for video editing. I started editing videos in 2014
            for my old Youtube channel(now gone... dont go looking for it). These videos were edited with my old iPad and thats
            where I got a real touch for editing videos. I made some memes on my phone later on (they were terrible). I would 
            always show my friends the memes I made and it would almost always make them laugh. Thats when I wanted to spread
            my memes around the world to make people laugh. To my knowledge, thats what ive been doing, even though my page
            was never very successful(and I hope it will be eventually). Nowadays I am still making memes, but I am also 
            getting into music production. I started with some mashups(which you can find on my Soundcloud). I made a 14 minute
            mashup of several meme songs which was my crowning achievement at the time. I have since set greater goals. I am now
            dabbling in making EDM, and I have made excellent progress. I hope in the future I will be a world renown EDM
            artist and video editor.
